Hello and welcome to my Odoo repo
===

Been working with Odoo and some of the tools listed in here for a while now and some of the things I have learn along the way are: 
- work smart, 
- fail quickly, 
- there's always a better way and 
- don't be afraid to try new things.

These are some of the tools I use to work, deploy and test Odoo. This is just for fun don't use any of this in production environments **at least you know what you are doing**.
